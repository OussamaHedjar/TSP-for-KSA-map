# TSP-for-KSA-map

Travelling salesman problem (TSP) is an algorithm to solve the following problem question:

For a given set of points or locations find the shortest route between them,and visit each point exactly once.

So I used 3 alogrithms to solve this problem, which are:

1. Genetic Algorithms.
2. Hill Climbing.
3. Simulated Annealing.

The idea of the solution was to implement a map using an arraylist of edges for each city, and the arraylist has:
1. Neighbor of the city.
2. distance between the two cities.
To make that map, I used two CSV files, one contains the cities coordinates and the other the distance between each city and its neighbor.

NOTE 1: THE SECOND FILE IS NOT COMPLETE, IT HAS A NUMBER OF MISSING CONEECTIONS.

After finsihing the map, all what was left is to implement the algorithms.

NOTE 2: I learned how to implement these algorithms after watching one of the many tutorials available in Youtube, sadly I forgot the source video 
I have done this project a while back.

NOTE 3: I added the csv files in order to make it easier to look through them, yet I have to say it again that the coordinates file is misssing some connections.
